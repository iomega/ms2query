Keep track of all changes done during re-run:

Data cleaning:
- new GNPS data (downloaded 15-12-2021, 20:00 CET)
- additional name cleaning steps: (1) remove ";" at the end, (2) try compound_name.replace("_", " ") if first attempt failed
- add allowed_differences of 18.01 and 18.03
- name_search_depth=15 (instead of 10)

Model training:
- Use most common inchi for every unique inchikey (not the first one found as before)
- spec2vec: set n_required=5 (was =10 before)
